All great blogs started with some quotes and this blog will follow the same path.  I found a few great quotes thanks to [zenpencils]:

* Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail (Ralph Waldo Emerson)
* Always do what you are afraid to do (Ralph Waldo Emerson)
* Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered you will never grow up (Ralph Waldo Emerson)

In addition, I want to include other quotes, that are not so famous but still interesting.

* Practice until your fingers bleed, then put on bandages and practice until they fall off. . . . . Then practice some more (Paul Harris)
* Do not make unimportant things important (Dai Vernon)
* Practicing is a lot like the bank. If you don't put anything in, you won't get anything out (Dai Vernon)

I am a third year Phd student at [Technical University Kaiserslautern](http://www.uni-kl.de/startseite/) (Germany) at [Multimedia Analysis and Data 
Mining(MADM)](http://www.madm.eu) (former [Image Understanding and Pattern Recognition](http://www.iupr.com)).  My
research interests are multimodal inputs, pattern recognition and neural networks (specially LSTM).

I am a Ph.D. student at [Technical University Kaiserslautern](http://www.uni-kl.de/startseite/) (Germany) at [Multimedia Analysis and Data Mining(MADM)](http://www.madm.eu) (former [Image Understanding and Pattern Recognition](http://www.iupr.com)).  My supervisors are _Prof. Thomas M. Breuel(Google, fomer position Professor at TU-Kaiserslautern)_ and _Prof. Andreas Dengel(DKFI, Head of the Knowlegde Management Group)_.  The goal of my thesis is to combine **Multimodal Inputs using Neural Networks**.  Before to start my Ph.D., I studied Computer Engineering at [ESPOL](http://www.espol.edu.ec) in Ecudaor.  Then, I did my master in Artificial Intelligence at [K.U.Leuven](http://www.mai.kuleuven.be) (Belgium) with _Prof. Moens_.  My master thesis is _Autorship Recognition in an unsupervised envorinment_.  I was working as a Lecturer for eight semesters at Computer Science and Electrical Engineering Department [FIEC](http://www.fiec.espol.edu.ec) at ESPOL.  I gave several lectures (Introduction to Programming, Data Structures, Object Oriented Programming and Artificial Intelligence) to undergraduate students.  In addition, I was project leader at [CTI](http://www.cti.espol.edu.ec), which is research center associated to ESPOL.
